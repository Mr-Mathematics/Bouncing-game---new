Bouncing-game--new 

I tried to write a small game. The window itself is the field, it bordered by three walls (left, right, top). The fourth side (bottom) is open, there is a racket at that side. There is also a ball in the field, its speed is constant. It bounces back from both the walls and the racket. It can fall down at the bottom. The racket has to be controllable by mouse and/or keyboard. If the ball falls down, the game exists
